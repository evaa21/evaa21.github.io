I chose MIS because it seems to be useful to have knowledge regarding technology. I am also majoring in Finance and Accounting, and I believe that MIS will give me a competative advantage. The MIS program seems like it could help me think more logically and could help me culitvate problem solving skills. Also, learning the skills of programming, analysis, managing projects, etc. seem useful. 
I am pursuing a career mainly in investment banking and various other trades within investment finance. MIS is a relevant subject in this field especially with technological applications becoming evermore relevant in the day to day task. I took this course last year and had to postpone completetion due to circumstances such as pursuing an internship within my intended field and prioritize certain classes. 
This year I plan to make this class a priority considering I have less class work. However I must plan ahead and strategically considering I have two valuable yet demanding internships. All in all this semseter will be a great learning experience.
