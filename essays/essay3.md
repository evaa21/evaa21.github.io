Introduction
Here is a breakdown of my experience doing the WOD's, but first I will explain how I would prepare for each one. Before begining my all my WOD's I go through a series of steps to prepare. First, I read the entire instructions to pin-point what needs to be accomplished. Second, I identify what parts I might not fully understand or feel that I may get stuck on. I try to find where I have learned the process or look at the issue further through an online resource such as W3 schools. Third, I make sure my other tools are ready for use such as my timer and my Quicktime player application for screen recording. Once I those three steps are done I am ready for my first attempt. I always do at least 2 attempts for each Wod in order to solidify my understanding of the tasks intructed.

Browser History 6
Browser History 6 was a pivotal assignment in learning to efficiently format information from a beginners point of view within CSS. Here is the link to the instruction page for more detail: https://dport96.github.io/ITM352/morea/040.dynamic-web-pages/experience-browserhistory6.html I utilized buttons in order to take the "client" to different web pages (files). Also utilized the onmousover function to make the web page more dynamic in its images. I feel as if I was still rusty with moving around vs code. However, it took me approximately 14 minutes to complete the tasks the second time around and the Rx: was <20. This affirmed to me that I was becoming more efficient in my coding in addition to building more effective skills for this course. This assignment was a bit more advanced from previous wods but it was not too difficult. 

SmartPhoneProducts with Variables
SmartPhoneProducts1 was the first derivative of the smartphone products file we worked on in class. Here is the link to the instruction page for more detail: https://dport96.github.io/ITM352/morea/050.variables_data_types/experience-SmartPhoneProducts1_variables.html This really helped me build upon my understanding of applying variables into my code. It cemented my understanding of script usage and its importance for using javascript within an html file. I rememeber having trouble loading the products_data.js file which drove me a little crazy and it ended up being as simple as a typo. This taught me the importance of copy paste in addition to attention to the smallest detail. I also managed to save time by practicing to use the find and replace features. Watching the screenscast I was able to see how I could improve in efficiency to save time.
 
Invoice 1
Invoice 1 was essentially an introduction to creating a sales receipt that could be changed using variables and expressions. Here is the link to the instruction page for more detail: https://dport96.github.io/ITM352/morea/060.expressions-operators/experience-invoice1.html Invoice 1 was intimidating at first considering the amount of steps and time given compared to previous wods. Preparing for this wod and understanding what I was unsure about was crucial. I planned out what computations were needed and began completing the WOD step by step. I got stuck when we had to calculate tax because I could not figure out how to make the number a percent in vs code. Then I remembered the professor mentioning that we would have to put it in decimal form. Adding comments was extremely advantageous in this Wod and gave me a newfound appreciation for them.

Invoice 2
Invoice 2 was a breeze compared to the first one ^. It basically just builds upon the the first by adding a dynamic shipping policy. Here is the link to the instruction page for more detail: https://dport96.github.io/ITM352/morea/070.flow-control-I/experience-invoice2.html It was super short and fairly easy for me to do. It was good practice for using if else statements. The "trickiest" part was making sure the brackets ({}) withing the statemnt were in the right position. Sometimes vs code likes to be annoyingly proactive and create weird problems if you don't add the brackets before inputting the content. Overall I was able to finish under 9 minutes and upheld the quality checklist. 

SmartPhoneProducts 2
SmartPhoneProducts 2 was not too bad and improved upon Smartphoneproducts1. Here is the link to the instruction page for more detail: https://dport96.github.io/ITM352/morea/080.flow-control-II/experience-SmartPhoneProducts2.html. Everything went smoothly until I forgot to put a closing > on my image which messed with the formating of the entire webpage. I drove myself insane the entire day trying to find the problem since vs code and the console were not telling me anything. Finally, I reached out for help from professor Kazman and he plainly pointed out the issue and how to fix it. In a way I am grateful for making the mistake I made becuase from now on I will always be sure to have closing > on my tags and to ask for help when needed. 

Conclusion
Overall, these WODS have been extremely helpful in building up my skills in programming. I've learned to utilize fundamental and practical methods of coding with the use of functions, variable, templates, strings, comments, etc. Each WOD I have been able to measure my proficiency in the course. Working through these problems has provided me with confidence to move forward in the class. I have found that learning by doing has been one of the best ways to apply myself in my education. For future wods I aim to improve in my narration and continue to build my skills to improve from previous assignments.
