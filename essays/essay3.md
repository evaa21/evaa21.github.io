Before I began to work on my BrowserHistory6 assignment, I decided to quickly refresh on what had been done during the last three BrowserHistory assignments.
I did this becuase it is important to understand what makes up the template of this webpage such as crucial HTML and styling. 
I opened the index files in my chrome browser so I could be prepared to check on my changes. Then I read through the instructions.
When I intially read through the instructions, I had the sense that I would struggle much more compared to the previous assignments.
Nevertheless, I opened Zoom, enabled the share screen,and then I started my timer. I began following the instructions,
while attempting to recall everything that been covered throughout the course so far. It was not long before I got stuck at the part where we input events regarding the buttons,
as well as figuring out what exactly needs to be left in the stylesheet. Luckily, I was able to watch an example of the solution presented my Professor Daniel Port. 
His solution was a bit more complex, but it definitely helped me from exploding with frustration. I would say this part is most crucial in my growth because it teaches me to not give up.  
Since, I do not have exacting photographic memory. I decided to attempt the assignment a few more times knowing they wouldnt be the last attempt. 
After the third attempt, I felt as if I could write the assignment in my sleep, which is why attempting to run through the assingments over and over is the best way to learn to code.
