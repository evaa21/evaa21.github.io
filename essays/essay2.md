When I first began this class I was particularly nervous about the assigmnets. In particular, I was nervous about the workouts of the day (WOD's) due to the fact that I am not very experienced in coding. 
I have taken a few online courses in various computer languages, however I felt that I did not retain enough information to take anything further. I believe that these courses were insightful, but they did not offer assignments that tested my ability.
The three browser history assignments definitely tested my abilities in terms of what I have learned so far in this course. Additionally, it was really helpful to be put under a time pressure while still having the freedom to try again. 
WOD's are a true representation of what it means to learn from your own mistakes. 
Each browser history assignment built on the previous one. 
We first started off doing the absolute fundamentals creating folders, files, and begin inputing the intial html code. Second, we began going farther into the basics of formatting and styling using CSS code. Third, we had to do more detrailed styling such as organizing the content into columns while keeping it organized, it required more integration between the html and css files.
The second assignment took me the most amount of attempts. I think it was difficult for me to differentiate the methods and syntax html and css, which made it difficult to get the files to cooperate. 
The second assignment was like a warm-up for the third assignment, which seemed intimidating at first. 
I am glad to be able to finish the assignments before the Rx (prescribed) time, because it gave me confidence to tackle the next one.
